This July, we mark the anniversary of gvNIX, Â¡we celebrated 5 years!

For 5 years now, Generalitat Valenciana put their faith in the development of this
open source tool for rapid Java web application development,
a development environment highly productive, flexible and does not compromise
the quality of projects.

For 5 years now, we are involved and committed to free software,
5 years of work and hundreds of _commits_,
fixing issues and continuous improvements,
during which we moving away from a framework
towards a complete development tool for your Java projects.

Over the course of the past 5 years, during which our user community has grown and evolved with us;
5 years during which have grown the number of projects, both privately and in public administration;
5 years during which we have made a firm commitment to training,
at both companies and students at different education centers.
5 years during which we are consolidated as standard for Java development of
the General Directorate for Information Technologies (DGTI) of the Generalitat Valenciana.

We are very glad about the improvements and growth forecast of gvNIX.
Now, our objective is to enhance the interaction between the developer community,
join efforts and share knowledge.

Congratulations to each and every one of the development team of gvNIX!
Thanks to all users of gvNIX!
