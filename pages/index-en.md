# What is gvNIX

gvNIX is a open source tool for rapid development Java web applications,
highly productive, flexible and that does not compromise project quality.

It is the development tool that is going to provide you all benefits of a
development tool for building web applications.

gvNIX creates applications based on various frameworks and integrates,
configure these frameworks and configures how they relate. gvNIX gives you
patterns and best practices beyond each framework or library that you employ.

With a life cycle for your applications that going from analysis to
maintenance.
Spend time to the business logic with a homogenised project with a unique
structure for any type of project.

# Why gvNIX

## Multiplatform

gvNIX is easy to install as a standalone tool that works on Windows, Mac OSX,
Linux or as an integrated tool environment Development: STS or Eclipse.

The only requirements are Java 6 SDK and Apache Maven 3. Once
installed, gvNIX distribution is downloaded, unpacked and added
the PATH system and launched the environment in gvnix command.

## Internationalization

Include support for adding new languages in the project. When you include a new
language is added automatically in the application with the necessary
infrastructure and texts translated into that language.

## Command Interpreter

From the point of view of its use, gvNIX is designed as an interactive
shell-style Rails or Grails.

For ease of use has autocomplete commands and context help.

## User interface responsive

Integrates web development frameworks, including [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/),
in the application to generate the responsive view with HTML5 structure and CSS3
that is automatically adapted for display in multiple devices: tablets,
phones, laptops, PCs...

In addition, these development frameworks using web standards in such a way that
set accessible websites bases for people who use assistive technologies
to navigate.

## Spring MVC - Integration of jQuery

Converts projects based on Dojo in projects on jQuery UI.

Adds support for form validation and optimizes the JavaScript code included in
the HTML document.

## Integration of Dandelion DataTables

Integrates more dynamic and functional components: pagination,
global search, column filtering, sorting, various sources of
Data: AJAX, DOM, etc;

Allows the register mode view, inline edit, editing and
deleting multiple,  set predefined of operations,
record created in first position, selection always visible...

Create patterns and details
[Dandelion DataTables] (http://dandelion.github.io/datatables/)

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Loupe component

Allows to use loupe type components in applications. Thanks to these
components, we can easily find records of fields related
without viewing all data in a dropdown.

## Master detail multilevel

Allows you to define display patterns on entities and their relationships:
allowing any combination [Master-tabular | master-registration] with
[Detail-tabular | detail-registration], with no limit on the number of relationships
both direct and indirect.

## Production performance monitoring

Integrates a monitoring system for Web applications in production.

The necessary infrastructure is created to record runtimes for
the different elements of the application: generation of view, SQL queries,
execution methods, HTTP request.

Also is created a page where we can see statistics data collected.

## Filter Wizard

Filtering systems table data allow not only compare text
plane but to define filtering operations with * CONTAINS () *,
*> = *, * DATE () *, etc.

To enable filtering by column automatically integrates an assistant
which allows the user to choose the filtering operation per column.

## Geographic Component

gvNIX automatically generates pages for display, listing,
search, create and edit alphanumeric data and also incorporates the
view on a map of the same data.

Allows editing of the location of elements, the location of data that
being edited by selecting a point on a map.

Allows the generation of geoportals. Any gvNIX application may incorporate a
geoportal in which all data are managed from the display
application as different layers as well as integration with the rest of
application pages.

# Technology

gvNIX lets you build the data model of an application using forward and reverse
engineer and generate a management application (web or not) in multiple
display technologies (Spring MVC, Flex, JSF, Vaddin ..)

gvNIX has been implemented with Java language and follow a model of
component-oriented architecture of OSGi platform in which each functionality
that provides the framework is implemented as a component or add-on that works
with the rest in different generation tasks.

It consists of a set of open source tools in particular its core, Spring Roo.
The technology includes gvNIX is most often used today with 40% of the study
population uses as Spring MVC framework technology.

# Open Source Project

Tool free and open source software based on Spring Roo.
This gives you a wide support from important organizations like
Spring Source and VMWare.

## Benefits

* The evolution of applications is not blocked by the evolution of gvNIX.
Integrating new functionality in an application does not require previously
be added to gvNIX.

* Fix incidences in the application does not depend on gvNIX,
can be solved in the application itself and then reports to
gvNIX project to include as improvement in future versions.
